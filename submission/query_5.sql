-- The `hosts_cumulated` table is designed to store cumulative activity data for each host.
-- This schema includes three columns:
-- 1. `host` (VARCHAR): This column stores the name or address of the host.
-- 2. `host_activity_datelist` (ARRAY(DATE)): This column stores an array of dates indicating when the host was active.
-- 3. `date` (DATE): This column stores the current or latest date for the activity data.

-- The table uses the Parquet format for efficient data storage and retrieval. Parquet is a columnar storage format that is optimized for use with big data processing frameworks.
-- Additionally, the table is partitioned by the `date` column. Partitioning improves query performance by allowing the database to scan only relevant partitions based on the date, thus reducing the amount of data read during queries.
