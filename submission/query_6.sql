-- This query incrementally populates the hosts_cumulated table by merging new web event data with the existing cumulative data.

-- Step 1: Define a CTE (Common Table Expression) for yesterday's data
-- The yesterday CTE retrieves the records from hosts_cumulated for the previous day.
-- Step 2: Define a CTE for today's data
-- The today CTE extracts the relevant data from the web_events table for today's date.
-- Step 3: Insert the merged data into hosts_cumulated
